## Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1
This involves environment setup to perform the task.
### Set Up GitHub
In this project, we'll use GitHub to track changes to our code and save them online in a new GitHub repo created for this purpose and which will be used throughout the project.

## Milestone 2
This involves creating variables for the game.
### Create variables for the game
Using basic python commands such as the if-else statements and while loop to perform this task.
