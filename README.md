## Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1
This involves environment setup to perform the task.
### Set Up GitHub
In this project, I use GitHub to track changes to the code and save them online in a new GitHub repo created for this purpose, which will be used throughout the project.

## Milestone 2
This involves creating variables for the game.
### Create variables for the game
Using basic python commands such as the if-else statements and while loop to perform this task.

## Milestone 3
This is about checking if the guessed character is in the word
### Check if letter is in Random word
Using functions to check if a letter is in a randomly chosen word

## Milestone 4
This entails creating a class for the game
### Create the Game Class
Using OOP knowledge to create the game class to develop the hangman game

## Milestone 5
Putting it all together
### Game starts!
Class is now prepared and game starts!
### How to Run the Game

```Bash
# To run the game, run the milestone_5.py script
python milestone_5.py
```
Example of a python code: 
```Python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
